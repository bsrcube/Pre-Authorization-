# Pre-Authorization

Predict if the prescribed medicine requires pre-authorization or not. 

Prior Authorization - Any process that requires an approval from the insurance company, be it a service or a procedure, before being administered to the patients can be referred to as prior-authorization (PA). Sometimes they are also interchangeably used referred to as pre-authorization, pre-certification, prior approval, prior notification and also as prospective review.

The goal is to develop an engine, for doctors that tell whether prescribed medication will require a prior authorization or not. This helps the doctors prescribe those medicines that do not require Prior Authorization in turn and reduces the service time for pharmacy, service process time for insurance, increases the probability of medication purchases and thereby improved health of patients. This engine looks at the past transactional data and predict with high degree of confidence whether a particular drug will require prior authorization for a particular patient or not.
